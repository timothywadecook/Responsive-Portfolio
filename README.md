# Responsive-Portfolio
This is a responsive professional portfolio template for web developers

Hey! just wanted to note that I used my own breakpoints based on what I liked and looking at the devices that were available on devtools. Hope this is cool. My site is responsive though and I learned a lot building it. I also played around with pseudoclasses and animations just a little. If you have any questions please let me know. Thanks, Tim.
