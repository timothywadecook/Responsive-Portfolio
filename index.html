          Hello world and welcome to my online portfolio. If you like what you
          see, feel free to sit silently there with your computer screen idling
          in front of you and think to yourself...
        </p>

          "Damn, what if I had a website like this to showcase all the things I
          can do. What if I knew how to build it too. Maybe I should Google how
          to become a web developer. Since I like the way this guy did his
          page...maybe the first thing I'll do is learn devtools and come back
          to this dope website and inspect it and build one just like it. How
          long have I been sitting here thinking these things? What was I doing
          again? Oh yea, who cares about me. I'm obviously here to learn about
          ...Timothy Wade Cook? Who TF does he think he is? Same name as the CEO
          of APPLE? LOL. I bet he gets great support when he walks into the
          Apple Store. Damn. That's actually a pretty major perk. Maybe I'll
          name my son after him. Or daughter. A perk's a perk. No lines. Fast
          fixes. Alright back to why I'm here.
        </p>

          Who is this guy? Someone who likes to build things. Somebody who
          enjoys solving problems and loves working with cool people to tackle
          big problems and learning together as a group. Someone who likes to
          surf and travel last minute and at any point in time is just a plane
          ticket away from suddently moving to Nicaragua for a few months where
          he can code and catch waves at the same time. He is originally from
          Atlanta (OTP just to be clear. He doesn't claim ITP. Haters Hate).
          There's a lot more you could learn about him. Maybe just click the
          Contact button in the top right and see what happens."
